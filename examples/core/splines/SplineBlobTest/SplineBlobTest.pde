/**
 * <p>SplineBlob demo showing how to use the Spline2D class to create generative
 * character outlines as used in http://postspectacular.com/work/nokia/friends/
 * Once the outline is generated is horizontally deformed by another spline
 * constituting the character's "spine".</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key controls:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>1 : draw blob outline</li>
 * <li>2 : draw blob deformed by spine</li>
 * <li>3 : draw blob both (1) and (2) overlaid</li>
 * </ul>
