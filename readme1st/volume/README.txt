This is a module of the toxiclibs library release.

Only the following packages are included:

toxi.volume

from toxiclibscore:
(get it via: http://hg.postspectacular.com/toxiclibs/downloads/)

toxi.geom
toxi.math

If you're going to use these classes for Processing projects,
first drop the "volumeutils" folder into the "libraries" folder of your
Processing sketchbook and ensure the above listed dependent libraries
are installed there too. You'll then need to restart Processing in order
for it to find this new library.

Source code is available via Hg, instructions over here:
http://hg.postspectacular.com/toxiclibs/source/

JavaDocs are available in the "docs" folder of each download and online.
