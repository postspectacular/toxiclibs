/**
 * This subdivision strategy splits an edge in three equal parts using two split
 * points at 33% and 66% of the edge. The split points themselves are being
 * displaced, however, in the direction of the vector going from the configured
 * reference point (often the mesh centroid is used) towards each split point.
 * The displacement amount is configurable as fraction of the original edge
 * length. So given that:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * S = edge split point
 * R = reference point
 * l = edge length
 * a = displacement amplification factor
 * 
 * S' = S + (S-R) * a * l
 * </pre>
